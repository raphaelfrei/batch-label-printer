# Label Printer
<p>Print TXT Label from CSV</p>
<p>I designed this program to help me print some large Thermal Labels quantity - Instead of editing each file renaming each Name and Code - I simple add this into the program and suggested where it should rename the variables</p>

## How It Works:

**1-** Open the program;

**2-** Provide the **TXT File** *(Label char)*;

**3-** **Data File** *(From **CSV**)*;

**4-** In the **DataRow**, suggest what does the row in the CSV will replace

**5-** Select the desired **PRINT OPTIONS**;

**6-** Select the **PRINTER**;

**7-** DONE!
